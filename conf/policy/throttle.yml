#   Your limits might be a little streched, depending on the speed of
#   the log parser (+1 or +2 or something).
#   However, this is the only way to assure only not-rejected mails
#   get accounted for.
#   If disabled, ANY mail seen will increment the counter (if a later
#   configuration setting does reject it, it still counts!)
