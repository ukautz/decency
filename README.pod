=over

=item * is a highly configurable postfix policy daemon, SMTP content filter.

=item * aims to reduce your spam significantly.

=item * tries to be as easy as possible for the admin.

=item * is designed to work in small, one mailserver setups as well as in complex distributed multi mailserver, multi filter server environments.

=item * does not cost you a dime because it is free open source software.

=item * has an interface to implement existing anti-spam solutions.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT STATE

decency is close to beta, but not yet there. However, it has already passed months of production (yes, i can run it, but you shouldnt) and real time tests survived. Some modules have less and some have more. It's mostly a matter of not having the time to write the docu, cleanup unused stuff and so on.
